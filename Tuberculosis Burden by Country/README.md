# Project Description

This project involved developing an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze global Tuberculosis (TB) burden, death rates, and case detection metrics. The key objectives were to:

## Visualize the global distribution of TB burden, including incidence and mortality rates
- Analyze trends in TB deaths by region and time period
- Evaluate the Case Detection Rate (CDR) across various countries and regions
- Identify disparities in TB outcomes based on regional and socio-economic factors
- Provide data-driven insights to support public health initiatives, policy-making, and resource allocation

The dashboard integrates TB data from various global health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. It allows users to explore key metrics interactively through a set of filters, parameters, and drill-down capabilities.

# Key visualizations include:
-  TB burden (incidence) trends over time, broken down by regions
-  Death rates and mortality trends, with regional comparisons
-  Case Detection Rate (CDR) across regions, visualizing gaps in diagnosis
-  A geographical heatmap of TB case detection rates, highlighting regions with the highest and lowest dtection rates
-  Forecasting and trend analysis for TB cases and deaths, helping to identify future hotspots

This dashboard aims to empower global health organizations, governments, and NGOs to better understand the TB epidemic, track progress toward control targets, and direct interventions more effectively.
