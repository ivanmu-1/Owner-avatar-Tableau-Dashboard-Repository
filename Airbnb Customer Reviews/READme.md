# Project Description

This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze Airbnb booking data across New York City's boroughs. The key objectives were to:

## Provide insights into borough-specific trends in Airbnb reviews, bookings, and pricing.
- Analyze room type distribution and review patterns across different boroughs.
-  Highlight key hosts with the highest number of reviews and corresponding pricing strategies.
-  Identify monthly and seasonal booking trends to uncover peak and low-demand periods.
-  Enable users to explore neighborhood-level price variations and availability.

The dashboard integrates Airbnb data, allowing users to interactively explore metrics using filters, parameters, and visualizations.

# Key Visualizations include:
- Total Available Bookings by Boroughs: A breakdown of bookings segmented by borough and room type.
- Average Numbers of Reviews by Room Type: Review patterns over time and across boroughs.
- Top 10 Hosts by Reviews & Pricing: Highlighting the most-reviewed hosts and their pricing strategies.
- Monthly Booking Trends: Insights into peak booking periods and borough-specific seasonality.
- Borough-Level Pricing Comparisons: Comparing average prices for listings across boroughs.
- Geographical Heatmap: Visualizing neighborhood-level price data and distribution of listings.
- Neighborhood-Level Price Breakdown: A detailed view of average prices within specific neighborhoods.
 
This dashboard aims to empower Airbnb hosts, guests, and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding pricing, availability, and market positioning. It also provides actionable insights for understanding consumer trends and optimizing rental strategies.
